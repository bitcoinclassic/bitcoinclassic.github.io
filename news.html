          <h3>Release Classic 1.2.0</h3>

          <p>January 5, 2017. Today Bitcoin Classic announces the release of version 1.2 of the stable full node client.</p>

          <p>This release marks a change in strategy for Bitcoin Classic, moving from the very conservative block size proposal based on compromise to one where Classic truly innovates and provides a long term solution for the market to choose and leave behind the restrictions of the old.</p>

          <p>The most visible change in this version is the decentralised block size solution where node operators decide on the maximum size. This idea is already getting major acceptance in the market.</p>

          <div class="moreContent hideContent">
          <p>Bitcoin Classic is focused on providing users a way to get onto the Bitcoin network using a high quality validating node for a large set of use cases. Classic presents top notch quality processes in this release, to help anyone running Bitcoin.</p>

          <p>We include in this release various projects with the beta label. People who want to use the Classic node as an on-ramp to Bitcoin will find them interesting. These projects will need to be enabled in the config by those that want to test them.</p>

          <p>More background information on this release and Classic can be seen in this video: <a href="https://vimeo.com/192789752">https://vimeo.com/192789752</a>.

          <p>Bitcoin Classic ships several exciting technologies in this release:</p>

          <ul><li>Decentralise <a href="https://bitcoinclassic.com/devel/Blocksize.html">block maximum size</a> This is the answer to the block size debate, operators can decide themselves what size limit to enforce.</li>

          <li><a href="https://bitcoinclassic.com/devel/Flexible%20Transactions.html">Flexible Transactions</a> A beta version that solves problems like the malleability issue using an upgrade to the transaction format. This is meant for further testing on testnet-ft.</li>

          <li><a href="https://bitcoinclassic.com/devel/AdminServer.html">Admin Server</a> Use your full node as a gateway to Bitcoin for high speed access and remote monitoring purposes. Feature incomplete and thus marked beta.</li>

          <li><a href="https://bitcoinclassic.com/devel/NetworkManager.html">Network Manager</a> A new low-level component that is currently used by the Admin Server. It is build for high speed communication with many hosts at the same time.</li>

          <li>Linux <a href="https://bitcoinclassic.com/linuxbuilds.html">improved packaging standards</a>.  For Linux we package Classic for the distro families Ubuntu and ArchLinux. These packages now allow the most convenient way of running a node with no configuration needed and pre-configured systemd and cookie-based bitcoin-cli remote management integration.</li>

          <li>xthin block transfer technology This technology was adopted from another client as a way to make sending blocks and immensely faster and more bandwidth friendly.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Release 1.1.1 and 1.2 (Beta) with Flexible-transactions and Xthin Support</h3>
          <p>Bitcoin Classic 1.1.1 Release Announcement (released September 19)</p>

          <p>The Classic team is happy to announce a bugfix release 1.1.1 This release includes binaries, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/releases/tag/v1.1.1">from github</a></p>
          
          <div class="moreContent hideContent">
            <p><b>Bitcoin Classic 1.1.1</b> is based on Bitcoin Core version 0.12.1, and is compatible with its blockchain files and wallet. Additionally, this release includes the increase of the block size limit from one megabyte to two megabytes. This bugfix release fixes various issues and we believe this is the best stable version of Classic and we recommend everyone upgrade as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>One notable change is that starting at this release <b>Bitcoin Classic will no longer respond to network-alerts</b>. This change means we no longer have to trust certain people that never really had any association with Bitcoin Classic.</p>


            <p><b>Bitcoin Classic Beta Release 1.2 (released September 20)</b></p>

            <p>Bitcoin developer, Tom Zander announced <b>Flexible Transactions</b> and <b>Xthin-blocks</b> support was added to Beta 1.2 today, the first milestone towards the release of Bitcoin Classic 1.2. This beta version is now ready, and can be downloaded <a href=" https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/releases/tag/v1.2.0.b1">from github</a>.</p>

            <p>As a new minor release, 1.2 comes with a lot of new features as well as many bug fixes and improvements.</p>

            <p>There will be more detail as we get closer to the release.</p>

            <p><b>Flexible Transactions</b> &#8212; FlexTrans is a new transaction format that solves all cases of transaction malleability and thus makes Bitcoin ready for future technologies like the Lightning Network. It also cleans up a lot of technical debt and provides a clear road forward for a long list of protocol improvements which will be possible, equally clean and technical-debt free.</p>

            <p>For instance FlexTrans allows us to remove signatures from a block after it has been validated, which in practice means about 75% size reduction. Additionally this technology completely replaces any need for segregated witness. Flexible Transactions is a new technology and would benefit from more usage and testing. This release does not allow Flexible Transactions on main-net.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/documentation/blob/master/spec/transactionv4.md">Specification</a></p>

            <p><b>Xthin-blocks</b> - This release includes support for the extra-thin blocks technology which solves the problem of block propagation causing delays because it only sends a small fraction of the data when a block is found and cleverly rebuilds it from the mempool of its own node.</p>
