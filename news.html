In this episode Tom goes over the Flexible Transactions proposal for Bitcoin, a protocol upgrade that solves a list of issues.</br>This video can be seen as an introduction to the technology as the actual research and development is feature complete where we proceed to the stabilising phase.</p>

          <h3>Release 1.1.1 and 1.2 (Beta) with Flexible-transactions and Xthin Support</h3>
          <p>Bitcoin Classic 1.1.1 Release Announcement (released September 19)</p>

          <p>The Classic team is happy to announce a bugfix release 1.1.1 This release includes binaries, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/releases/tag/v1.1.1">from github</a></p>
          
          <div class="moreContent hideContent">
            <p><b>Bitcoin Classic 1.1.1</b> is based on Bitcoin Core version 0.12.1, and is compatible with its blockchain files and wallet. Additionally, this release includes the increase of the block size limit from one megabyte to two megabytes. This bugfix release fixes various issues and we believe this is the best stable version of Classic and we recommend everyone upgrade as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>One notable change is that starting at this release <b>Bitcoin Classic will no longer respond to network-alerts</b>. This change means we no longer have to trust certain people that never really had any association with Bitcoin Classic.</p>


            <p><b>Bitcoin Classic Beta Release 1.2 (released September 20)</b></p>

            <p>Bitcoin developer, Tom Zander announced <b>Flexible Transactions</b> and <b>Xthin-blocks</b> support was added to Beta 1.2 today, the first milestone towards the release of Bitcoin Classic 1.2. This beta version is now ready, and can be downloaded <a href=" https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/releases/tag/v1.2.0.b1">from github</a>.</p>

            <p>As a new minor release, 1.2 comes with a lot of new features as well as many bug fixes and improvements.</p>

            <p>There will be more detail as we get closer to the release.</p>

            <p><b>Flexible Transactions</b> &#8212; FlexTrans is a new transaction format that solves all cases of transaction malleability and thus makes Bitcoin ready for future technologies like the Lightning Network. It also cleans up a lot of technical debt and provides a clear road forward for a long list of protocol improvements which will be possible, equally clean and technical-debt free.</p>

            <p>For instance FlexTrans allows us to remove signatures from a block after it has been validated, which in practice means about 75% size reduction. Additionally this technology completely replaces any need for segregated witness. Flexible Transactions is a new technology and would benefit from more usage and testing. This release does not allow Flexible Transactions on main-net.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/documentation/blob/master/spec/transactionv4.md">Specification</a></p>

            <p><b>Xthin-blocks</b> - This release includes support for the extra-thin blocks technology which solves the problem of block propagation causing delays because it only sends a small fraction of the data when a block is found and cleverly rebuilds it from the mempool of its own node.</p>
