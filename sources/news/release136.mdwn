## Release Announcement Bitcoin Classic 1.3.6

August 30th, 2017.

Bitcoin Classic updates the 1.3 version with various bugfixes. We added some solutions for Bitcoin Cash based nodes where some users reported them having a database inconsistency which caused them to get stuck.

After the successful creation of Bitcoin Cash we proudly present the stable, most user friendly Bitcoin full node that allows you to choose the Bitcoin you want.

* Full Bitcoin Cash support, using the UAHF name. A special download is available.
* Ability to automatically migrate and separate out the Bitcoin Cash data from the traditional chain.
This allows users to run two nodes, each following a different chain.
* Faster re-connecting to Bitcoin Cash capable nodes by remembering which nodes support it.
* Full zero-fee transaction support. From relay for others as well as creation in the wallet and mining.
* Much improved log-file support. Including runtime reloading of config-file using SIGHUP.

This client is fully compatible with the [Bitcoin Cash](https://bitcoincash.org) spin-off from Bitcoin, but using the default settings we ignore it. You can change the config-file, or we point you to the specialized [UAHF](release136uahf.html) version of Classic.
