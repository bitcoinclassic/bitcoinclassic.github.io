## Release Announcement Bitcoin Classic 1.3.2

August 1st, 2017.

Bitcoin Classic updates the 1.3 version to add a migration strategy.


This client is fully compatible with the [Bitcoin Cash](https://bitcoincash.org) spin-off from Bitcoin, but using the default settings we ignore it. You can change the config-file, or we point you to the specialized [UAHF](release132uahf.html) version of Classic.
