[[!meta title="Bitcoin Classic Announces the 1.2.3 Stability"]]

## Release Announcement Bitcoin Classic 1.2.3

March 22, 2017.
Following a string of issues with code that Classic borrowed elsewhere, we finally took responsibility for the adopted code and fixed a lot of issues in that code which direction affect stability and reliability of a node.

On top of that, this feature makes the existing flag `-use-thinblocks` a proper flag which actually turns off codepaths to this feature should the operator turn it off.

We recommend Bitcoin Classic version1.2.3 for everyone, especially if you already were running a version with thinblocks (xthin).
