[[!meta title="Bitcoin Classic Announces the 1.2.3 Stability"]]

## Release Announcement Bitcoin Classic 1.2.3

March 22, 2017.
Following a string of issues with code that Classic borrowed elsewhere, we finally took responsibility for the adopted code and fixed a lot of issues in that code which directly affect stability and reliability of a node.

Additionally, this feature makes the existing flag -use-thinblocks a proper flag which allows the operator to fully turn it off, making the code of this feature unable to be executed by misbehaving networking nodes.

We recommend Bitcoin Classic version1.2.3 for everyone, especially if you already were running a version with thinblocks (xthin).
