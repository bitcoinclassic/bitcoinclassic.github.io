<h1 id="Blocksize">Blocksize</h1>

<p>In Bitcoin transactions are gathered in blocks which are structured in a
chain. The reason we use a chain is because of the main innovation
of Bitcoin which combines it with Proof of Work to have a global consensus
about the transactions that are accepted.</p>

<p>What is completely irrelevant to this process of gaining consensus is the
size of each block.  And we can see that over the lifetime of Bitcoin the
size of blocks has grown based solely on the requirements of the network.</p>

<p>Miners have always been the ones to decide on the block size, and they have
always done this in a coordinated fashion. This is a natural consequence of
the rather elegant (economic) design of Bitcoin.</p>

<ul>
<li>Miners earn more (fee) income when they produce bigger blocks.</li>
<li>Miners take more risk of their blocks being orphaned with bigger blocks.</li>
<li>Miners want to avoid emptying the memory pool every block as that removes
a total need for users to pay fees.</li>
<li>Miners want to make sure the mempool does not become backlogged because
users that do not see their transactions confirmed will get disappointed
and find other means to do payments. Which hurts the price and in effect
hurts the miners income.</li>
</ul>

<p>These contradictory values cause the miners to be the ideal custodians
of the block size. The most correct block size is dependent on
the amount of paying users and the state of technology. To get the most
profit out of the system the miners will have to find a market-equilibrium
for the block size. That market equilibrium happens to be the best for
all players in Bitcoin.</p>

<h2 id="The_solution">The solution</h2>

<p>For some time now this process has been a problem because the Bitcoin
protocol has a rule since 2010 which sets the block size to a maximum of
1MB. The reasons for this limit have long been fixed and there is no longer
any reason to have this limit.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Classic has removed the 1MB centrally planned limit from its
software and gives tools to users and miners to protect themselves from
malicious actors at the same time. We call that the <strong>accept limit</strong>.</p>

<p>The main change is that a Bitcoin Classic node can now be configured
manually to have any block size limit.</p>

<p>First there is the new <code>blocksizeacceptlimit</code> config setting that
allows a user to limit blocks by size they will accept from the
network. For instance if the user would set <code>blocksizeacceptlimit=4.2</code> this
states that any block over 4.2MB is rejected as too large.</p>

<p>The old config option <code>blockmaxsize</code> is unchanged and this is the option
that miners set to determine the maximum block size they would create.</p>

<p>The additional change is that Bitcoin Classic creates block templates for
miners which put the blocksizeacceptlimit value in the coinbase comment.
This has the effect that a miner's limits are stored in the blockchain and
for everyone available to see.  Any miner can check the blockchain and find
out what a safe blockmaxsize setting will get his blocks accepted by other
miners. But ultimately we expect miners to have a global conversation, in
any forum that works for them, about the block size they will all use.</p>

<h2 id="Additional_safety_measures">Additional safety measures</h2>

<p>With the introduction of a more soft size limit, one that is no longer
centrally planned by software developers but instead based on local
configuration, we see an opportunity to introduce add an extra fail-safe in
unique situations where a user's configured limits are not representative
of the real world any longer.</p>

<p>Should a user have configured his limits lower than what miners agreed would
be the current block size, we want to avoid the users node to essentially
reject what the rest of the world sees as the main chain.
This is especially important if there is only one block that is slightly
larger than expected.  With the user configured limit as a hard limit
a node rejects any block too large and this would break the chain and the
client can't accept any blocks after that point either.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Classic introduces a design that takes this configurable size limit
and makes it possible for a node to recover and get back on the main
chain.</p>

<p>It is important to stress that this feature is made possible due to the
user configurable size limits, but there is no reason to believe that it
will actually cause problems like orphans or chains forks that require this
feature.</p>

<p>This safety measure is currently still under development and is introduced
on Toms blog <a href="https://zander.github.io/Blocksize%20Consensus.html">here</a></p>
