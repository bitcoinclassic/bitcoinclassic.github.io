<p><strong>In Bitcoin Classic the block size is no longer limited by rules set by
software developers. It is set by you, the person running the software.</strong></p>

<p>This article explains how this works.</p>

<h2 id="Picking_the_perfect_Blocksize">Picking the perfect Blocksize</h2>

<p>In Bitcoin transactions are gathered in blocks which are structured in a
chain. The reason we use a chain is because of the main innovation
of Bitcoin which combines it with Proof of Work to have a global consensus
about the transactions that are accepted.</p>

<p>The size of this block has never been relevant to this process and we can
see that over the lifetime of Bitcoin the size of blocks has grown based
solely on the requirements of the network.</p>

<p>Miners have always been the ones to decide on the block size, and they have
always done this in a coordinated fashion. This is a natural consequence of
the rather elegant (economic) design of Bitcoin.</p>

<ul>
<li>Miners earn more fee-based income when they produce bigger blocks.</li>
<li>Miners take more risk of their blocks being orphaned with bigger blocks.</li>
<li>Miners want to avoid emptying the memory pool every block as that removes
a total need for users to pay fees.</li>
<li>Miners want to make sure the mempool does not become backlogged because
users that do not see their transactions confirmed will get disappointed
and find other means to do payments. Which hurts the price and in effect
hurts the miners income.</li>
</ul>

<p>The genius of this balance has the natural consequence that blocks will not
be made too big or too small, their size will be based on the amount of
paying users and the state of technology. To get the most profit out of the
system the miners will have to find a market-equilibrium for the block
size. This market equilibrium also happens to be the best for owners and
merchants of Bitcoin.</p>

<h2 id="What_does_Classic_do.3F">What does Classic do?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin Classic has removed the 1&nbsp;MB centrally planned maximum block size
limits from its software and gives tools to the miners and users to protect
themselves from malicious actors at the same time. We call that the
<code>accept limit</code>.</p>

<p>Classic will accept blocks produced by all other current implementations of
node software, including Core, Unlimited, etc. Blocks produced by Classic
will be accepted by all other softwares, including Core, if less than
1&nbsp;MB and by Unlimited and others but not by Core if blocks created are
1&nbsp;MB or larger.</p>

<p>Classic will put the user-selected (or default) block size limit in the
coinbase message in the form "EB3.7" where the number is the amount of
megabytes per block this node accepts.</p>

<h2 id="How_do_I_configure_this_on_my_Classic_node.3F">How do I configure this on my Classic node?</h2>

<p>The main change is that a Bitcoin Classic node can now be configured
manually to have any block size limit.</p>

<p>First there is the new <code>blocksizeacceptlimit</code> config setting that
allows a user to limit blocks by size they will accept from the
network. For instance if the user would set <code>blocksizeacceptlimit=4.2</code> this
states that any block over 4.2MB is rejected as too large.</p>

<p>The existing config option <code>blockmaxsize</code> is unchanged and this is the option
that miners set to determine the maximum block size they would create.</p>

<h2 id="Way_forward">Way forward</h2>

<p>Classic has been in conversation with miners and other Bitcoin companies
for some time and the way forward to breaking the 1&nbsp;MB limit is
clearly one where we move the control over the blocksize out of the hands
of the software developers and make it a market-set property. That is the
most healthy solution going forward.</p>

<p>How this is going to be done is an on-going conversation. It is very
optimistic to know that people are in fact talking about how to solve this
and in general agreement that it needs solving. Classic is there to make
suggestions only, not to dictate policy or make decisions on which solution
to pick.</p>

<p>Some things are for certain, a block size increase will happen and the
planning and details will be made very public when they have been decided.</p>

<p>Either way, Classic will be part of the movement.</p>
