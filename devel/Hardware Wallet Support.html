<h1 id="Hardware_Wallet_Support">Hardware Wallet Support</h1>

<p>In Flexible Transactions we included an idea that has been first proposed
many years ago, but unfortunately it never made it into Bitcoin before.</p>

<p>This feature allows hardware wallets, like <a href="https://www.bitlox.com"
target="_extern">bitlox</a>
in the future to create transactions in the FlexTrans format and they will
be even safer from any mistakes or tampering with the mobile app or the
website.</p>

<h2 id="What_is_the_problem_.3F">What is the problem ?</h2>

<p>Hardware wallets use a 2-phase way of creating valid transactions.
First is that they use a computer connected to the internet to create the
base transaction. This computer decides how much money has to go where and
it connects to the Bitcoin network to find out.</p>

<p>The second phase is that this transaction is send to the hardware device
which actually holds the private keys and so is used to actually authorise
the transfer.  After user authorisation it signs the transaction and you
can send it to the network for mining.</p>

<p>This all sounds very safe and secure, except for one design issue in
Bitcoin. The amount of coins that a certain address holds is not part of
the transaction that spends it.  An attacker could mislead the computer
that creates the transaction so it would be under the impression that there
was only 1 BTC on an address that in reality holds 2BTC. The effect is that
the hardware wallet would ask the user permission with wrong information
and the user would lose the difference to mining fees.</p>

<h2 id="How_do_we_solve_that.3F">How do we solve that?</h2>

<p>The 2-phase creation of transactions, as explained above, that is used by
all hardware wallets today would remain largely unchanged. The only
difference is that the computer that creates the initial transaction would
additionally send the amount it thinks the transaction is worth to the
hardware wallet for signing.</p>

<p>If the transaction is created as a <a href="./Flexible Transactions.html">Flexible Transaction</a> the hardware
wallet will use the input-amount in the creation of the signatures.
This makes the signatures to only be valid if the input amount the hardware
wallet has received was correct.  If anyone was compromised, the user will
not lose funds because a full node validating the transaction will simply
reject the transaction.</p>

<h2 id="I_want_to_know_more.">I want to know more.</h2>

<p>This gets technical very quickly after this point, so thank you for
sticking around!</p>

<p>Any Bitcoin transaction has its inputs signed because that is the way we
prove that the money we are spending was actually ours to spend. The
concept of signing involves a private key that only you know and it
involves the actual content we sign. Your legal document, essentially.</p>

<p>In Flexible Transactions we define the concept to sign for a specific
input to be the entire body of the transaction. We additionally add some
data (see the full list in the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/documentation/blob/master/spec/transactionv4.md#scripting-changes">spec, section Scripting
Changes</a>)
that when hashed together creates one number we then sign.</p>

<p>Any full node, including mining nodes, that we send the transaction to
will validate the signature to be correct.
Those full nodes will know exactly how much money is stored in a specific
address / index pair. The way Bitcoin works, you always transfer 100% of
the money stored in a specific address/index pair when you refer to that in
the transaction input. To validate that transaction input signature it
is a simple matter for the full node of adding
the amount it had stored in the unspent transaction database and validating
that the transaction is correct.</p>

<p>Should the 'amount' that was used by the hardware wallet while signing not
correspond with the 'amount' that any full node knows, this will mean it
signs something different and thus the signature will fail to validate.</p>

<p>As a result, this means that a hardware wallet can ask the user for
permission to sign something and the user can be sure that the transaction
will only be accepted with the amount she just saw on the hardware wallet.</p>

<p>This simple solution costs no extra bytes in the transaction and secures
the users trust in the payment technology.</p>
