# Bitcoin Classic for developers.

Bitcoin Classic is an open source project that is hosted on
[[github|https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic]].

In Bitcoin Classic we have been working on several projects which
are either shipped or in progress of being developed.

## [[Flexible Transactions]]

Flexible Transactions is a solution for a series of problems that were
present in the initial version of Bitcoin. The most well known of which is
the transaction-malleability issue.  
FlexTrans is a protocol upgrade that is in the finishing state of research,
but the actual roll-out plan to integrate this into Bitcoin is still being
decided.
