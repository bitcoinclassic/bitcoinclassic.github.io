<h1 id="How_do_SegWit_and_FlexTrans_compare.3F">How do SegWit and FlexTrans compare?</h1>

<p><a href="./Flexible Transactions.html">Flexible Transactions</a> was started as an alternative solution when it became
apparent that Segregated Witness was not going to be a viable protocol
upgrade.</p>

<p>This document attempts to describe the reasons why this is the
case and how the two solutions compare and where they are completely
different.</p>

<p>The reader should realise that the two solutions were both started with a
single goal in mind which is to solve the <a href="./Malleability.html">Malleability</a> issue. Where
FlexTrans aimed to keep it simple and small, SegWit had as a goal to avoid
at all costs making changes that would get the new transactions rejected by
old nodes. The reason for this is cited to be that old wallets and nodes
have no need to upgrade after SegWit becomes operational.</p>

<p>The reality of the situation is that people will need to upgrade their
wallet anyway. As Bitcoin gets its value from networking we can see that
networking will cause a ripple effect of upgrades. People that receive a
payment from a SegWit user will not have any progress reports of that
payment unless they have a SegWit wallet. Users pay more to users that
don't have a SegWit wallet. The networked basis of money makes it a
certainty that practically all people need to upgrade.
And that begs the question if there really is a benefit to the SegWit
solution.</p>

<p>Lets start by looking at the end result. What did the implementations
actually accomplish.</p>

<p>In the last row this is about an economics issue where SegWit introduces "Two Buckets" with new pricing and new fee bidding.
In the design of SegWit the signatures part of a transaction are to be charged 75% less than the rest, making two buckets of data. The designers of SegWit decided that the miners should incur the cost where miners do up till 4 times the work, for the same pay.
This is an anti-feature where technical design is trying to gain an influence on economic policy and thus very much worth putting a cross in the SegWit column for.</p>

<h2 id="Technical-debt-matrix.3B">Technical-debt-matrix;</h2>

<p>This is about the cost of the design. As the term 'technical debt' implies, this is not a one time cost, this is an actual debt that needs to be paid off over time with more engineering cleanup. The actual cost paid is thus in future productivity and stability of the system.</p>

<p>Like any company or household, if you don't pay off your debt, you will eventually work for nothing other than keeping afloat and not make any progress.</p>

<h2 id="Future_growth">Future growth</h2>

<p>Bitcoin is meant to be around for many years, even decades. People want a
stable money.</p>

<p>SegWit has as its <strong>only</strong> feature for the future that it allows the
Lightning Network to be deployed. The capacity increase is a joke compared
to the needs of the network right now. It certainly is not a capacity that
can be used in the future.  Even with Lightning on top, the capacity
allowed in a SegWit world will not allow Bitcoin to grow as peer to peer
cash.</p>

<p>Flexible Transactions is not a capacity increase, it is a separate solution
that can be combined very well with any capacity increase. <br />
Additionally, it is a format that is made to be extended. Adding fields to
the format is expected and can be done safely. FlexTrans even dictates in
the specification the allocation of various forwards compatible fields
which can be used for soft upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="Deployment">Deployment</h2>

<p>The main drive for SegWit was to avoid forcing people to SegWit. What we
see today is that the same authors are pushing people really hard to get
the latest. They even used the alert system to get people to upgrade their
client.</p>

<p>All this means that in actual fact the 'safe' upgrade strategy of SegWit is
not happening. There is no benefit in their architecture over FlexTrans.</p>

<p>The Flexible Transactions deployment is a protocol upgrade that has as of
today not been planned. The likely method is to decide that at a specific
time (counted in blocks) in the far future this upgrade will become
active. Allowing everyone many months to upgrade. <br />
If a user did not upgrade before the date hits his client will give a
warning and he will be told to upgrade. Until he does there will be no
service. This will guarantee no loss in funds and no loss in security or
privacy.</p>

<h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>The Flexible Transactions solution solves all problems that SegWit solves.
On top of the features that SegWit has it lists some more which are
essential to a healthy on-chain future growth for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Flexible Transactions cost a fraction of SegWit, both in code written and
future work to keep the network running.</p>

<p>The goal of SegWit that it would be easier to deploy, allowing people to
not upgrade should they not want it, turns out to not be reached and it
ends up dictating economic policy which is a sure sign of bad design.</p>

<p>There is no reason to choose SegWit over Flexible Transactions.</p>
