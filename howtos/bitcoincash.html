<p>From August 1st, 2017 a so called split-coin was created with the name <strong>Bitcoin Cash</strong> (BCC).</p>

<p>All Bitcoin people were holding before that date is split. Much like a stock-split. Everyone holding 1 BTC before the split-coin was created will hold 1BTC and 1BCC afterwards. This howto explains how you can run both a Bitcoin legacy as well as a Bitcoin Cash node, allowing you access to coins on both sides of the chain.</p>

<p>Bitcoin stored in a Bitcoin Classic or Core wallet will be auto-converted, Bitcoin stored on paper wallets can be imported twice, once for each side of the split.</p>

<p><strong>Please ask yourself this first; do I need to follow this tutorial?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do I have BTC in a Core or Classic wallet? Do I have it in a paper-wallet? <br />
If you don't, the only benefit will be that you can run two full nodes on one machine that share the chain-data. If you don't know why you would need to do that, this tutorial is likely not for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you run Bitcoin Classic as a normal user, or do you run it as a background service?
If you run it on your machine under a different user, likely with your block data in a system-directory, this tutorial is not for you. A more specified howto should be written soon.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use pruning of your blockchain data then you may not be able to use this tutorial. You would need to re-download the entire blockchain.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Goal">Goal</h2>

<p>Our goal today are the following;</p>

<ul>
<li>We end up with a Bitcoin Cash fully synchronised client that allows you to send and receive BCC.</li>
<li>We still have full access to the Bitcoin Legacy data, including the wallet.</li>
<li>And data that can be shared between the chains will be shared. Avoiding long processing times or large disk space usage.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Ok.2C_lets_begin">Ok, lets begin</h2>

<p>Bitcoin Classic started supporting Bitcoin Cash in version 1.3 with a special download called the "UAHF" download.
You can find it as a direct download on <a href="/downloads/bcc/index.html">downloads</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you quit any other full node software you have on your computer.</li>
<li>Please download the latest version of Bitcoin Classic UAHF for your architecture and install it.</li>
<li><p>Start Bitcoin Classic UAHF. <br />
At this point Bitcoin Classic will start to use a new data directory. This directory is called <code>BitconCash</code>.
The first start of Bitcoin Classic UAHF will do a data-migration of any data that was used by a formerly installed Bitcoin full node client on your machine. This migration will not touch the old data. Depending on how fast your machine is, this may take a couple of seconds to a couple of minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>You should see on the splash-screen or in your logs that Bitcoin Classic will do a "rollback" of blocks back to the fork-point
which was where the Bitcoin legacy and Bitcoin cash split and went its separate ways. <br />
After reaching the fork point the client will continue to start as normal and start to download the new chain.</p></li>
<li><p>Congratulations, you are now able to see and transact Bitcoin Cash transactions. Make sure to notice the usage of <code>BCC</code> in the user interface which is the main distinction to the legacy chain where we use <code>BTC</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Shut down Bitcoin Classic UAHF.</p></li>
<li><p>Download the Bitcoin Classic release, the one without Bitcoin Cash. Install it in a different directory as the one we installed in number one. The intention is to have both on the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Start the new Bitcoin Classic (non-UAHF).</p></li>
<li><p>It should start and show you a very similar screen as above, but now with BTC.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's all folks, you can start any client and do transactions without having any effect on the other side of the split.</p>
